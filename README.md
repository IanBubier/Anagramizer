CS 361 Software Engineering I

This is Ian Bubier's course project for Oregon State University's Computer Science 361 - Software Engineering I. It 
demonstrates familiarity with message queue and microservice concepts. When all microservices are running, the 
Anagramizer will generate and store English language anagrams according to instructions given through a terminal-based 
user interface.
